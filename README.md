## How it works

The project is divided into two parts:

[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:popmodeler/frontend.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd frontend

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The application will open on the port: 3000 - go to http://localhost:3000
